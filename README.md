# Mis-Matched Adventures

Mis-Matched Adventures is an experimental journey in creating a browser game prototype. This project is intended for the fulfillment of the academic requirements of the Software Engineering Immersive programme from General Assembly.

## Description

Mis-Matched Adventures is a browser Role-Playing Game where you take control of a pizza chef that was transported into a foreign world by unknown means. Run around the stylised world fighting slimes and dragons in an attempt to get stronger and find a way back home.

This project is based on Javascript and uses a Class-based approach to the writing of its codes. All components are housed within their own classes with respective CSS files for styling, if any.

The live version of the game is accessible from [this link](https://andrewtaiye.github.io/dev).
